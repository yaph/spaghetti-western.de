        <description><![CDATA[The Specialist, also known as Specialists and Drop Them or I'll Shoot, is a 1969 Spaghetti Western co-written and directed by Sergio Corbucci. It was co-produced with West Germany and France and was released in France under the title Le spécialiste and in Germany with the title Fahrt zur Hölle, ihr Halunken. The title is probably intended to partner the previous Corbucci western, The Mercenary.]]></description>
