        <description><![CDATA[Those Dirty Dogs is a 1973 Italian-Spanish Spaghetti Western film written and directed by Giuseppe Rosati and starring Gianni Garko and Stephen Boyd. The film was made in the later part of the spaghetti western boom. As such it features such latter-day genre elements as self-parody, guffaw humour, near-slapstick fight scenes, machine guns hidden in everyday household items, and bombastic villains.]]></description>
