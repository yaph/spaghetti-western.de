        <description><![CDATA[Those Dirty Dogs is a 1973 Italian-Spanish-American Spaghetti Western film written and directed by Giuseppe Rosati and starring Gianni Garko and Stephen Boyd. The film was made towards the very end of the spaghetti western boom. As such it features such latter-day genre elements as self-parody, guffaw humour, near-slapstick fight scenes, machine guns hidden in everyday household items, and bombastic villains.]]></description>
