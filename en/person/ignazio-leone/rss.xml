        <description><![CDATA[A Stranger in Paso Bravo is a 1968 Italian-Spanish Spaghetti Western film directed by Salvatore Rosso. It was the first and only film directed by Rosso, who had previously been assistant of a number of directors, notably Pietro Germi. The film was remade in 1969 by Antonio Margheriti as And God Said to Cain; despite being the same story and having the main characters sharing the same names, the two films list different screenwriters. The film underperformed at the Italian box office, grossing only 34 million lire.]]></description>
